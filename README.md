# SM64 Olaia Over Mario
a mod of sm64 that replaces the mario model with my skin!, enjoy.
# How to install
extract the zip and drop the mario folders inside to your repo (if you use dynos then drop it in repo/build/us_pc/dynos/packs, and the other thing to do is optional), compile with external data then done! (if you use sm64ex-nightly dont do that)
